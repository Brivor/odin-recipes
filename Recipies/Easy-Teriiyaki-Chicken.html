<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Teriyaki chicken is a Japanese dish of grilled chicken brushed with a mixture
  of soy sauce, mirin, and sake. The word teriyaki is a compound that describes
  both the marinade and cooking technique: “teri” means gloss and “yaki” means
  to cook, fry, or grill.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 cup soy sauce ($0.24)</li>
  <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar ($0.12)</li>
  <li>1 Tbsp water ($0.00)</li>
  <li>1 clove garlic, minced ($0.08)</li>
  <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger ($0.10)</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil, divided ($0.08)</li>
  <li>1.75 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs ($5.72)</li>
</ul>
<h3>steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare the marinade first. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water,
    garlic, ginger, and 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil in a bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the chicken in a shallow bowl or dish, then pour the marinade over
    top. Turn the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well coated. Let
    the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to one day (refrigerated), turning the
    chicken occasionally as it marinates.
  </li>
  <li>
    When ready to cook the chicken, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a
    large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken, discarding the
    remaining used marinade.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until cooked through
    and the liquid in the skillet has reduced to a light coating of glaze on the
    chicken.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5 minutes
    before slicing and serving.
