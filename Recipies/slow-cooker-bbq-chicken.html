<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This slow cooker BBQ chicken is almost too easy to be true. Just add some
  seasonings to boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cover them with your
  favorite BBQ sauce, and press go. A few hours later, the chicken is tender,
  tangy, so saucy, and delicious!
</p>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp freshly cracked pepper</li>
  <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
  <li>18 oz. BBQ sauce</li>
</ul>
<h3>steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the seasoning over both sides of the chicken breasts.</li>
  <li>Place the chicken breasts in the slow cooker, then pour the BBQ sauce over top making sure the chicken is fully covered.</li>
  <li>Place a lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for 2.5 hours or low for 4-5 hours.</li>
  <li>After cooking, use two forks to shred the chicken. If the chicken does not easily pull apart with the forks, let it cook a little longer.</li>
  <li>Serve the pulled BBQ chicken on a bun, on nachos, over a baked potato, on pizza, or with your favorite meal.</li>
