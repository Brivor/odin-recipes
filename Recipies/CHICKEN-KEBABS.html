<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  These BBQ Chicken Kebabs are made with just a few super simple ingredients.
  They’ve got seasoned chunks of chicken breast, fresh-cut pineapple, red onion,
  BBQ sauce, and a few fresh green onions for garnish. They’re light, fresh, and
  perfect for the summer BBQ season!
</p>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 small red onions (or one large</li>
  <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
  <li>1.3 lbs. Simply Nature Organic Chicken Breasts</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil, divided</li>
  <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
  <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 cup Burman's Original BBQ Sauce</li>
  <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
</ul>
<h3>steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Cut the red onions into 1-inch squares. Place the red onion in a bowl,
    drizzle with 1 Tbsp cooking oil, and toss to coat.
  </li>
  <li>Cut the pineapple into 1-inch cubes.</li>
  <li>
    Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch cubes, then place the chicken pieces in a
    bowl. Drizzle 1 Tbsp cooking oil on top, then add the smoked paprika, sweet
    paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss the chicken until it is well
    coated in oil and spices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build your kebabs by adding pineapple, onion, and chicken to skewers,
    alternating as you go. I got ten skewers, but the yield will vary depending
    on the length of your skewers and size of your pieces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat a grill or grill pan over medium. Once hot, add the kebabs and cook for
    a few minutes on each side.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the kebabs are almost cooked through, brush them on all sides with BBQ
    Sauce. Cook the chicken kebabs for a minute or two more on each side, or
    until the chicken is cooked through and the BBQ sauce is slightly
    caramelized.
  </li>
  <li>Sprinkle the sliced green onions over top just before serving.</li>
